# 100-days-of-code-python
Improving python coding skills in 100 days. Most of us are coding in python but know only necessary things. This is my attempt to expand the horizons. 

# Day 1: datetimes

# Day 2 & 3: Collections 
(https://docs.python.org/2/library/collections.html)
Some powerful datastructures to make your code less buggy and simple.
 1. namedtuple: Named tuples assign meaning to each position in a tuple and allow for more readable, self-documenting code. They can be used wherever regular tuples are used, and they add the ability to access fields by name instead of position index.
 2. defaultdict: Returns a new dictionary-like object. defaultdict is a subclass of the built-in dict class. It overrides one method and adds one writable instance variable. The remaining functionality is the same as for the dict class and is not documented here.
 3. Counter: A Counter is a dict subclass for counting hashable objects. It is an unordered collection where elements are stored as dictionary keys and their counts are stored as dictionary values. Counts are allowed to be any integer value including zero or negative counts. The Counter class is similar to bags or multisets in other languages.
 4. deque: Deques are a generalization of stacks and queues (the name is pronounced “deck” and is short for “double-ended queue”). Deques support thread-safe, memory efficient appends and pops from either side of the deque with approximately the same O(1) performance in either direction.
