# 100-days-of-code-python
Improving python coding skills in 100 days. Most of us are coding in python but know only necessary things. This is my attempt to expand the horizons. 

# Day 1: datetimes

# Day 2 & 3: Collections 
(https://docs.python.org/2/library/collections.html)
Some powerful datastructures to make your code less buggy and simple.
 1. namedtuple :Named tuples assign meaning to each position in a tuple and allow for more readable, self-documenting code. They can be used wherever regular tuples are used, and they add the ability to access fields by name instead of position index.
 2. defaultdict : Returns a new dictionary-like object. defaultdict is a subclass of the built-in dict class. It overrides one method and adds one writable instance variable. The remaining functionality is the same as for the dict class and is not documented here.
 3. Counter
 4. deque
 
# Day 4 : Data structures (Classes and objects)
